          Community fridges are used by many people everyday, oftentimes working
          class families, the elderly, and unhoused people looking for an extra
          food source. A common value is respect for the autonomy of each
          refrigerator and those who depend on them.

          The thousands of fridges in action represent a variety of identities
          and ethos that are as unique as the neighborhoods that run them.
          Refrigerators are independent and decentralized. They are operated by
          local businesses, mutual aid groups, neighbors, and organizations.

          The first known community fridge was started in 2014. Since then,
          artists popularized these public resources by decorating the fridge
          doors to attract curiosity and welcome participants. This creative
          element effectively transforms an everyday object into a cultural icon
          that carries a powerful message about circular economics and mutual
          aid. As public art installations, fridges generate interest and expand
          the positive impact of food redistribution.

          A team of organizers and web developers formed in 2022 to create
          FridgeFinder, a map that tracks community fridges. Our app offers
          digital tools that empower volunteers to take action. By subscribing
          to a fridge and leaving status updates, the public strengthens a
          network of people running fridges. Maintenance is also streamlined and
          food transportation is mobilized. FridgeFinder shows the incredible
          everyday contributions of food justice advocates. Our goal as a team
          is to strengthen the capacity for long-term prosperity at featured
          locations.
